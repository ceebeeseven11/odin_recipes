    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>Cake</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups canola or other vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup lightly packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>3 cups grated peeled carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup coarsely chopped pecans</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raisins</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Frosting</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8oz cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups powedered sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cold heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans, for topping the cake</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottom
            with parchment paper and then grease the top. Or grease and flour the bottom and sides of both pans.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit(176C)/</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until well blended.</li>
        <li>In separate bowl, whisk oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla together.</li>
        <li>Add eggs one at a time, whisking in between each egg.</li>
        <li>Add in dry ingredients, whisking them in slowly.</li>
        <li>Divide cake batter into two equal parts between the cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the top is springy.</li>
        <li>Let cakes rest for roughly 15 minutes. Then, transfer them to a rack to cool on.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, start your frosting by beating cream cheese with a handheld mixer until creamy, about one minute on medium speed.</li>
        <li>Beat in powdered sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, until fluffy.</li>
        <li>Pour in whipping cream. Beat on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until frosting is whipped and creamy.
            This frosting resembles whipped cream in texture. Chill covered until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>When both cakes are completely cooled, frost the top of one cake. Then, layer the second cake on top and frost it as well.
            Use a knife to swirl the frosting around the top of the cake, but leave the sides un-frosted.</li>
    </ol>
